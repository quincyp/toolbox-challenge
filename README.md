Assets and file stubs for the Expanding Your Toolbox Challenge

Hi Zach,

Sorry about the lateness, I hope finals and gradings are going well for you!
I believe things should go smoothly, so hopefully grading won't take too long!
The page has what I believe to be intuitive win and instruction messages, just clicking anywhere to close the win and clicking the instruction button to toggle the instructions.

Best,
Quincy
